My research interests are around human-centric AI, computer vision and vision & language models. I currently serve as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Luxembourg, where I focus on deepfake detection. Previously, during my PhD at QMUL my research emphasis was on affect estimation, facial expression recognition, and mental health symptom estimation through video analysis. My work has been shared in top-tier conferences within my field, and I've been fortunate to engage in teaching and mentoring MSc students alongside my research. Before joining academia, I spent seven years in the industry, which has provided valuable insights into practical applications.
