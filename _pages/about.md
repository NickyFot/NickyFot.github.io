 I am currently a Research Scientist at Tavus in London, UK, where I focus on advancing Conversational Agents. In addition, I serve as a Visiting Lecturer at City University of London, where I teach "Deep Learning for Image Analysis" and supervise MSc thesis projects. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Luxembourg and a PhD at Queen Mary University of London. My expertise spans machine learning, multi-modal AI, and human-centred approaches, with a strong foundation in both academic research and industry applications.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my website - feel free to explore my [publications](/publications/), [projects](/projects/), and [CV](/cv/).
