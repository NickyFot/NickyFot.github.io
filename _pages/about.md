As a PhD candidate in Computer Science, I am currently in the final stages of my studies and expect to submit my thesis by Sep-
tember 2023. My research interests center around affect estimation, facial expression recognition, and mental health symptom
estimation, with a primary focus on utilizing video input. Through my work, I have had the privilege of publishing papers in top-
tier conferences within my field. Additionally, I have gained experience in teaching and supervising MSc students, and I remain
connected to the industry thanks to my prior 7-year career in the field.
