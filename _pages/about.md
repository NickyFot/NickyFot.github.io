 I am currently a Research Scientist at Toshiba Europe in Cambridge, UK, where I focus on advancing Multi-Merging of Foundation Models for Continuous Learning applied in generative models. My work explores novel approaches to combining reasoning across different modalities, merging models trained on diverse datasets or architectures, and enhancing continuous learning capabilities. Alongside this, I serve as a Visiting Lecturer at City University of London, teaching "Deep Learning for Image Analysis" and supervising MSc thesis projects. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Luxembourg and a PhD at Queen Mary University of London. My expertise spans machine learning, multi-modal AI, and human-centred approaches, with a strong foundation in both academic research and industry applications.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. Feel free to explore further!
